    {
        question: "How do I do Secret Santa without email?",
        answer: "You're in the right place! Unlike other sites, this is a free Secret Santa generator with no email or signups required. Simply enter participant names, generate matches, and download printable cards instantly. It's the easiest way to draw names online without needing registration."
    },
    {
        question: "Does Secret Santa work with an odd number of people?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Our generator works perfectly with any number of participants, odd or even, as long as you have at least two people. The algorithm ensures everyone gives one gift and receives one gift, no matter the group size."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between Secret Santa and White Elephant?",
        answer: "In Secret Santa, you are assigned a specific person to buy a thoughtful, personalized gift for. In a White Elephant (or Yankee Swap), participants bring one generic, often humorous, gift to a central pool, and then take turns choosing or stealing gifts from others."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I bulk upload a list of participants?",
        answer: "Yes! To save you time, our generator includes a 'Bulk Add from List' feature. You can paste a list of all your participants at once, and the tool will automatically add them for you. This is perfect for large office or family groups."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the basic rules of Secret Santa?",
        answer: "The rules are simple: 1. Everyone's name goes into a pool. 2. Each person secretly draws one name. 3. You buy a gift for the person you drew, keeping their identity a secret. 4. At the gift exchange, everyone gives their gift and reveals who they had. It's important to stick to the agreed-upon budget!"
    },
    {
        question: "How can I make my Secret Santa more interesting?",
        answer: "A great way to spice things up is by setting a fun theme for the gifts! Some popular ideas include 'Something You Make,' 'As Seen on TV,' 'Gifts Under $10,' or a color-themed exchange. You can add the theme details to the 'Event Details' section to have it appear on every card."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use this for holidays other than Christmas, like Halloween?",
        answer: "Yes! We call it a 'Secret Santa' generator, but it's perfect for any gift exchange. We even have built-in themes for Halloween (Secret Satan or Secret Pumpkin) and Valentine's Day (Secret Cupid). You can organize a gift swap for any occasion."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I set rules or prevent people from drawing each other?",
        answer: "Yes, our generator makes it easy to set rules. You can add exclusions to prevent specific people from drawing each otherâ€”perfect for couples in a family gift exchange or managers and direct reports in an office secret santa. This ensures everyone gets a fun and appropriate match."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I upload my own background for the cards?",
        answer: "Yes, you can! Our generator lets you upload a custom image (like a company logo or family photo) to use as the background for your printable cards. For best results, we recommend using a PNG image with dimensions of 3.19 x 4.13 inches (a quarter of a standard page). This feature allows you to fully personalize your gift exchange. Just select the 'Upload Image' option in the 'Style Your Cards' step."
    },
    {
        question: "Are the printable cards customizable?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You have full control over the look of your cards. You can change the text, choose different fonts, adjust colors, and even add a text outline for better visibility on busy backgrounds. All your edits are reflected in a live preview, so you see exactly what you'll get."
