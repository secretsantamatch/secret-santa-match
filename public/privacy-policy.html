        <h1>Privacy Policy for SecretSantaMatch.com</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: [Date]</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to SecretSantaMatch.com. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our service.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our service is designed to be private and anonymous. We do not require user accounts, emails, or any personal information to generate Secret Santa matches.</p>
        <p>The information you provide (participant names, event details, exclusions, etc.) is processed locally in your browser and encoded directly into the shareable URLs. This data is not stored on our servers.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>The information entered is used solely for the purpose of generating the Secret Santa matches and creating the printable cards and shareable links for your event. Since we do not store this information, we cannot use it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data related to your Secret Santa exchange is contained within the URL hash. This means the data resides on your device and is only shared when you choose to share the links. We do not have access to this data.</p>
        <p>We use local browser storage (localStorage) to save your list while you are setting up your event, so you can come back to it later. This data remains on your computer and is not transmitted to us. You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser's cache and data.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
        <p>We may use cookies or similar technologies for analytics purposes (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand how our service is used and to improve it. This helps us see how many people are using the site and which features are popular, but it does not track any of the personal names or details you enter for your gift exchange.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those other sites.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Your Contact Email].</p>
