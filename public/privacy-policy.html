        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 18, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to SecretSantaMatch.com. We are deeply committed to protecting your privacy. Our core promise is to provide a simple, effective Secret Santa generator without requiring you to sacrifice your personal information. This policy outlines how we handle data (or more accurately, how we *don't*).</p>

        <h2>1. The Core Generator: No Data Collected</h2>
        <p>When you use our main Secret Santa generator, we have a strict <strong>no data collection</strong> policy for your group's information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We do not ask for, collect, or store email addresses.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>We do not require you or your participants to create an account.</strong></li>
            <li>Participant names, exclusions, and gift exchange details are processed directly in your browser.</li>
            <li>All match data is compressed and encoded directly into the unique URLs that are generated. This information is stored in the link itself (in the part after the '#' symbol), not on our servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because of this, we have no way of seeing who is in your group, what the matches are, or retrieving lost links. This is by design to ensure maximum privacy.</p>

        <h2>2. The "Living Wishlist" Feature: Limited Data Storage</h2>
        <p>To enable the "Living Wishlist" feature, which allows participants to edit their wishlist after the draw, we must store the wishlist data. This is the only exception to our no-server-storage rule.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is stored:</strong> When an organizer generates matches, the content of the wishlist fields (Interests, Likes, Dislikes, Links, Budget) for each participant is saved to a secure, private database (Google Firestore).</li>
            <li><strong>What is NOT stored:</strong> We do NOT store participant names or the match results (who is giving to whom) in the database. The connection between a person and their wishlist is made via a unique, random ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it is stored:</strong> This is necessary to allow a participant to visit a unique link and update their information in a way their Secret Santa can see in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> This data is stored in a private database that only the site administrator can access for maintenance purposes. It is not sold, shared, or used for any other purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Website Analytics (Google Analytics)</h2>
        <p>We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site so we can improve it. This is done in a privacy-conscious way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data collected is aggregated and anonymized. We look at trends, such as which pages are most popular or how many people use the generator, not who is using it.</li>
            <li>We have enabled IP anonymization features within Google Analytics.</li>
            <li>We use a cookie consent banner. Analytics are only activated if you provide your consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Advertising and Affiliate Links</h2>
        <p>To keep our tool 100% free, we use Google AdSense to display advertisements and participate in affiliate programs (like Amazon Associates). This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website or other websites.</li>
            <li>Our affiliate links may place a cookie on your browser to track referrals if you make a purchase. This comes at no extra cost to you.</li>
            <li>You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Ads Settings</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to use our service without providing any personal information. You can use an ad blocker if you do not wish to see ads. You can decline our cookie consent for analytics. If you use the "Living Wishlist" feature and wish for your data to be deleted, please contact us, though proving ownership of anonymous data is difficult.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us through our <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
