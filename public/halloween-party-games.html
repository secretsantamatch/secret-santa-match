            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">Planning a Halloween party can feel like a monster of a task, but coming up with entertainment shouldn't be scary! Forget complicated setups and expensive supplies. We’ve brewed up a list of 15 no-prep Halloween party games that are perfect for kids, adults, and mixed groups. Plus, we have a special treat for you: <strong>free printable Halloween bingo cards</strong> to make your party an instant hit!</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 pt-4">Games for Kids & Families</h2>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">1. Monster Freeze Dance</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Put on a spooky playlist (think "Monster Mash"). Have everyone dance like their favorite monster. When the music stops, everyone must freeze in their monster pose. Anyone who moves is out. The last monster dancing wins!</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">2. Halloween Charades or Pictionary</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Write down Halloween-themed words (pumpkin, ghost, witch, vampire) on slips of paper and put them in a bowl. Players take turns drawing a slip and either acting it out (charades) or drawing it (Pictionary) for their team to guess.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">3. Find the Eyeball (or Pumpkin)</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> A simple Halloween twist on hide-and-seek. Have one person hide a small object, like a plastic eyeball or a mini pumpkin, somewhere in the room. The first person to find it gets to hide it next.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">4. Guess the Ghost's Favorite Food</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Blindfold one player (the "ghost"). Other players feed the ghost different foods from the party snack table. The ghost has to guess what they're eating. It’s hilarious to watch them guess between "witch's finger pretzels" and "gummy worms."</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">5. Pin the Spider on the Web</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Draw a large spiderweb on a piece of poster board and hang it on the wall. Give each player a paper spider with a piece of tape on the back. Blindfold them, spin them around, and see who can get their spider closest to the center of the web.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">6. Ghost Bowling</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Decorate a few rolls of toilet paper with black marker to look like ghosts. Stack them in a pyramid and use a small pumpkin as a bowling ball. It’s a silly and fun way to knock over some ghouls!</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">7. The Mummy Wrap</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Divide players into teams of two. Give each team a roll of toilet paper. One person is the "mummy," and the other is the "wrapper." The first team to completely wrap their mummy using the whole roll wins!</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 pt-4">Games for Adults & Teens</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">8. Horror Movie Trivia</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Prepare a list of questions about classic and modern horror films. Ask questions like, "What was the name of the hotel in 'The Shining'?" or "What line is famously misquoted from 'Silence of the Lambs'?" The person or team with the most correct answers wins.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">9. Two Truths and a Lie: Spooky Edition</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Each person tells three "facts" about themselves related to Halloween: two that are true and one that's a lie. (e.g., "I went trick-or-treating until I was 18," "I've seen a ghost," "My favorite candy is candy corn."). The group has to guess which one is the lie.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">10. What's in the Box?</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Fill a shoebox with spooky-feeling items. Think peeled grapes (eyeballs), cold spaghetti (worms), or a wet sponge (brains). Players have to stick their hand in the box without looking and guess what's inside. Their reactions are the best part!</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">11. Costume Contest with Categories</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Instead of just one "best costume" winner, create a few fun categories like "Most Creative," "Funniest Costume," "Scariest Costume," and "Best Couple/Group Costume." Let everyone vote by writing down their choices on slips of paper.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">12. Halloween Never Have I Ever</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Players take turns stating something they've never done related to Halloween. For example, "Never have I ever... dressed up as a vampire." Anyone who *has* done it takes a sip of their drink. It's a great icebreaker!</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">13. Spooky Song Mad Libs</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Take the lyrics to a famous spooky song like "Thriller" or "Monster Mash." Remove key words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) and ask the group to fill in the blanks without knowing the context. Read the hilarious new version out loud.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">14. Halloween Drink "Guess the Ingredient"</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Create a signature Halloween punch or cocktail. Have guests try to guess the secret ingredients. The person who guesses the most ingredients correctly wins a prize (or bragging rights).</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-700">15. Scary Story Circle</h3>
            <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Dim the lights and have everyone sit in a circle. One person starts a scary story with a single sentence. The next person adds a sentence, and so on. The story can get spooky, weird, or downright hilarious.</p>
