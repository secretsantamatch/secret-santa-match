Unlike Secret Santa where gifts are personal, White Elephant gifts are usually funny, weird, or semi-useful items that create a fun game of choosing and stealing gifts among players." } },

It's high enough for creative and funny gifts but low enough that no one gets too attached if their gift gets stolen." } },

Funny gifts create the biggest laughs when opened, while useful gifts fuel the most aggressive stealing. A gift that is both (like a ridiculous but functional kitchen gadget) is the holy grail." } },
        { "@type": "Question", "name": "Is it okay to re-gift something for White Elephant?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, re-gifting is widely accepted and even encouraged in White Elephant, as long as the item is new, in its original packaging, and fits the spirit of the game. Just make sure you're not re-gifting it to the person who gave it to you last year!" } }

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>What is the point of a White Elephant gift exchange?</h3><p>The point is entertainment! Unlike Secret Santa where gifts are personal, White Elephant gifts are usually funny, weird, or semi-useful items that create a fun game of choosing and stealing gifts among players. Need the full rules? Check our <a href="/white-elephant-rules.html">complete guide to White Elephant</a>.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>What is a good budget for White Elephant?</h3><p>A budget of $20 to $25 is the most common and effective range for a White Elephant party. It's high enough for creative and funny gifts but low enough that no one gets too attached if their gift gets stolen.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>What makes a good White Elephant gift?</h3><p>A great White Elephant gift is either genuinely hilarious (like the Screaming Goat), surprisingly useful (like a high-quality meat thermometer), or a combination of both. The best gifts are the ones people will actually want to steal during the game.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>What should you NOT bring as a White Elephant gift?</h3><p>Avoid bringing actual trash or broken items. The gift should be funny or quirky, not garbage. Also avoid inside jokes that only one or two people will understand, as well as inappropriate or offensive items that could make people uncomfortable.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>Should White Elephant gifts be funny or useful?</h3><p>Both are great! The best parties have a mix of both. Funny gifts create the biggest laughs when they're first unwrapped, while useful gifts tend to fuel the most aggressive stealing throughout the game. A gift that is both (like a ridiculous but functional kitchen gadget) is the holy grail of White Elephant.</p></div>
                <div class="faq-item"><h3>Is it okay to re-gift something for White Elephant?</h3><p>Yes, re-gifting is widely accepted and even encouraged in White Elephant, as long as the item is new, in its original packaging, and fits the spirit of the game. Just make sure you're not accidentally re-gifting it to the person who gave it to you last year!</p></div>
